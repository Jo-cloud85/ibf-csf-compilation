export class WeatherService {

    private readonly httpClient = inject(HttpClient);

    // Subject can serve as an observable, thus, we can subscribe to it
    /* 
    When you call getWeatherAsPromise in CityComponent, the onWeather subject in WeatherService emits the data, which is
    then available for any component subscribing to it, including WeatherComponent. 

    Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the data flows between the components and service:

    CityComponent:
      - CityComponent has a form where the user can enter a city name.
      - When the user submits the form, getWeatherAsPromise() is called with the entered city name.

    WeatherService:
      - getWeatherAsPromise() from WeatherService fetches the weather data from the API and then uses the tap operator to 
        emit this data via its onWeather subject.
      - This subject can have multiple subscribers and will emit data to all of them whenever it receives new data.

    WeatherComponent:
      - WeatherComponent subscribes to weatherSvc.onWeather in its ngOnInit method.
      - As soon as CityComponent calls getWeatherAsPromise() and the data is fetched and emitted by the onWeather 
        subject, WeatherComponent receives this data by subscribing to it and updates its weather property.
